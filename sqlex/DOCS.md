# SQLEX
My simple package to work with sql, essentialy used for fuyubase. "sqlex" could parse a sql schema into a schema struct in and vice versa it's also could dump a sql schema from the schema struct.

### Syntax
Currently It's only suppot mysql & sqlite3, since this is the sql base database that I use the most. Maybe I will add postgresql support in the future.
